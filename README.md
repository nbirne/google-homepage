# google-homepage

Take a look [here](https://nbirne.github.io/google-homepage/).

Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css) curriculum.

This project, in which I recreated the design of the Google homepage, was an opportunity to practice using HTML and CSS. In addition to gaining familiarity with various elements and properties, I learned a bit about CSS Flexbox, the Chrome Developer Tools, and HTML and CSS syntax.
